### Project Overview

The scope of this project is to develop a unique and professional looking portfolio to present to any prospective employers. 

The portfolio is meant to showcase my very best applications and the wide-variety of skills and styles that I have aquired throughout the course of my Web Development career... as well as a little about me as an individual.

The employer will be presented with a deployed application with a user interface that transitions smoothly and accomodates a variety of multi-media devices.
